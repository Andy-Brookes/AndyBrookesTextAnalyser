//PROJECT NAME - TEXT ABC ORDER

//as a text reader
//I want to read through some given text paragraph where the words are ordered 
		1.) Alphabetically, 
		2.) In order of upper case to lower case
		3.) Remove all all punctuation (comma, full stops, tabs) to make it easier to read
		4.) If words are present more than once, do NOT remove duplicate words
//so that I can easily scan though the words  alphabetically
