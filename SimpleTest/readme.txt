//PROJECT NAME - TEXT ABC ORDER

//as a text reader
//For a given Text paragraph, I want to readh through the paragraph where the text has been reordered and formatted as follows
		1.) Results should be oredred Alphabetically, 
		2.) Results should be ordered from upper case to lower case but point 1 takes preference.
		3.) Remove all commas, full stops, and tabs to make it easier to read
		4.) If words are present more than once, do NOT remove duplicate words
//so that I can easily scan though the words  alphabetically
